# Counter App
### **Overview**

This is a simple React-based Counter App designed to demonstrate the fundamental concepts of React such as component structure, props, event handling, and useState for state management. The application allows users to increase, decrease, or reset a number displayed on the screen.



### **Problem**

Manually updating values on a webpage can be inefficient and lacks interactivity. Traditional static pages donâ€™t offer the flexibility needed for real-time updates without reloading.



### **Proposed Solution**

This React application provides an interactive counter that updates in real time without refreshing the page. Using React's `useState` hook, the app keeps track of the current count and updates the UI dynamically based on user interactions.



### **Key Features**

-  **Increment**: Increases the counter value by one.
-  **Decrement**: Decreases the counter value by one.
-  **Reset**: Resets the counter to zero.
-  **Real-time Updates**: Instantly updates the count without reloading the page using React state.
-  **Simple UI**: Clean layout styled using basic CSS.



### **Tech Stack**

| Layer       | Technology Used   |
|-------------|--------------------|
| Frontend    | React.js (JSX)     |
| State Mgmt  | useState Hook       |
| Styling     | CSS                |



### **How It Works**

1. The counter value is stored using the `useState` hook.
2. Three buttons are provided:
   - **Increment**: Adds 1 to the current count.
   - **Decrement**: Subtracts 1 from the count.
   - **Reset**: Sets the count back to 0.
3. Every button click triggers an event handler that updates the state.
4. The updated count is displayed instantly on the screen.



### **Conclusion**

This project demonstrates how React can be used to create responsive and interactive user interfaces. It highlights how simple state management and event handling work in React functional components.
